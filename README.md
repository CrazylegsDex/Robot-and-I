# Overview of Robot and I
This GitHub repository contains the Unity files for the Senior Project at West Texas A&M University for the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters.

This project was developed by a team of five students and was developed using the Unity Game Engine. The team developed this game with the hopes
that players would be able to learn about the basics to programming by playing the game.

# Game Features
This game features a main menu and end credits, three islands for the player to roam around in top-down movement, self-developed game audio and
challenging 2D levels view that teach programming concepts. The game teaches programming concepts starting from variable declaraction to Pointers
in Pseudo Code, Python and C#.

# Structure of the repository
The Specifications Report Document for the project is located in the main directory and named SRS_Report.pdf
In the Assets directory contains folders for Graphics, Scenes, Scripts and Sound for the game with their respective names.

# Credits
Certain team members worked more on certain features of the game than others. Their works and credits are found below.

* Drake Bouska - Credit goes to Drake for his hard work in designing the majority of the graphics for the game.
Level_0, Backgrounds, Main Menu, Ending Credits and the overlay menus all were designed and implemented by Drake.

* Daphne Pate - Credit goes to Daphne for her hard work in designing the Islands that the player runs around.
The Islands and their graphics, Maps, NPC and several of the levels for the Python lessons were designed and implemented by Daphne.

* Lauren Taylor - Credit goes to Lauren for her focus in writing, re-writing and proof reading all the Dialogue in the game.
Every lesson, NPC Dialogue and also the Game Audio were written and implemented by Lauren.

* Travis Cox - Credit goes to Travis for the implementation of the Pseudo Levels and their respective gameplay.
Travis was responsible for implementing the first few levels that the team created and also handled the implementation for all seventeen Pseudo levels
the following semester. Travis also worked alongside Daphne in finishing the Python levels in the second semester.

* Dexter Downey - Credit goes to Dexter for his leadership role in the team and also the implementation of the game's primary mechanics.
Dexter was involved in heading the Scrum meetings and delegating tasks to the team. Dexter also managed the GitHub repository and managed
the merging of Branches into the main branch. Dexter also made it possible for the game to include runtime compilers for the Python and C#
languages that the player can use to complete the levels. Other game features include Saving and Loading, data transfer between scenes and an
in-game Notebook.

# The Future
This repository is hereafter considered finished and will not be returned to. For individuals wishing to continue the project, copy the code
